twitter\_fdw
============

This library contains a single PostgreSQL extension, a Foreign Data
Wrapper (FDW) handler of PostgreSQL which fetches text messages from
Twitter over the Internet and returns as a table. 

Installation
------------

    $ make && make install
    $ psql -c "CREATE EXTENSION twitter_fdw" db

The CREATE EXTENSION statement creates not only FDW handlers but also
Data Wrapper, Foreign Server, User Mapping and twitter table.

Usage
-----

After installation, simply query from `twitter` table.

    db=# SELECT from_user, created_at, text FROM twitter WHERE q = '#postgresql';

The layout of `twitter` table is as below:

                   Foreign table "public.twitter"
          Column       |            Type             | Modifiers 
    -------------------+-----------------------------+-----------
     id                | bigint                      | 
     text              | text                        | 
     from_user         | text                        | 
     from_user_id      | bigint                      | 
     to_user           | text                        | 
     to_user_id        | bigint                      | 
     iso_language_code | text                        | 
     source            | text                        | 
     profile_image_url | text                        | 
     created_at        | timestamp without time zone | 
     q                 | text                        | 
    Server: twitter_service

The column `q` is a virtual column that is passed to API as a
query string if the column is used with `=` operator as
WHERE q = '#sometext'. You can put any text as defined in the API
parameter `q`. Note the query string is percent-encoded by the module.
The other columns are mapped to the corresponding property name of
each tweet item in the API result. For more detail on these values,
see the API document.

Depencency
----------

This module depends on

  * [libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)
  * [libjson](http://projects.snarc.org/libjson/)
  * [Twitter API](http://apiwiki.twitter.com/w/page/22554679/Twitter-API-Documentation)

The source of libjson is included this module package and linked as a
static library, wheares libcurl is assumed installed in the system.
You may need additional development package, as `libcurl-dev` in yum.
